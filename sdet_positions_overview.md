# Positions and responsibilities overview

What‚Äôs a Career Framework?

* The Engineering Career Framework is your source for how to achieve impact
  for your role and team and how to grow in your engineering career.

* For managers, it can help you set expectations with your teams and
  hold them accountable for their work. Also it can be used to share
  detailed feedback

What‚Äôs not a Career Framework?

* This framework is not a promotion checklist for your role;
  rather, it‚Äôs designed to help you figure out what your impact could
  look like at the next level.

Golden template that can be used for individual person growth.
Based on [Dropbox career framework](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/ic2_sdet.html).
Use GH "Outline" feature to get a full overview.

Terms used:

* "Customer" - means either product customer or the 'internal' customer, i.e. company employee using internal products and/or frameworks maintained by the SDET team
* "SEV" - short form of the "Severity":
  * We define a SEV (severity) 1 incident as "a critical incident with very high impact." This could include a customer data loss, a security breach, or when a client-facing service is down for all customers.
  * A SEV 2 incident is a "major incident with significant impact," including when a client-facing service is down for a sub-set of customers or a critical function within a system is not functioning.
  * And a SEV 3 incident is "a minor incident with low impact," such as a system glitch that is causing customers slight inconvenience.
* :ballot_box_with_check: means personal requirement is declared but not achieved yet
* :white_check_mark: means personal requirement is declared and achieved
