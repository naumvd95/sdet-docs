### ü¶â Craft

**Code Fluency**



* The expectations for code fluency do not go beyond L3 , though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area (principal engineers)

**Software Design**



1. I design software components that are difficult to misuse and flexible in the face of an increase in the number of adjacent use cases as appropriate to the direction of the business (neither under nor over-designed)
2. I reduce complex designs and concepts to simple foundational components through correct choices of data structures, applications of algorithms, or other deep insight into the problem space and create simple interfaces to complex underlying systems
3. I‚Äôm able to review designs in related areas with high quality and ensure quality for cross-team cross-module design/API issues
4. I may have deep expertise in implementation or principles behind some of the libraries, platforms and systems relevant to my team's work

**Architecture Design**



1. I make correct technology choices for components needed as part of a larger architecture, including making build vs buy choices for specific components, and choosing frameworks
2. I‚Äôm capable of owning the overall health and engineering quality of a system or collection of features - e.g. driving regular health reviews, curating test strategy, etc - and ensuring that the health and maintenance of my systems do not depend on the maintainers having my expertise
3. I‚Äôm capable of driving overall testing strategy of a significant system with high reliability or quality requirements (e.g. building validation systems or new test frameworks to do so)

**Technical Strategy**



1. I‚Äôm accountable for alignment of the software and systems in my area to overall technical strategy, making tradeoffs where appropriate in consultation with principal engineers

**Quality Engineering Fluency**



1. Partnering with other SDET engineers and Software developers, I identify and develop high impact test/automation approaches and solutions that will have a lasting impact on the Quality Engineering area.
2. I identify and develop high impact test/automation approaches and solutions that will have a lasting impact on my team(s) ability to effectively manage quality for highly complex and ambiguous projects.
3. I effectively engage with other teams outside of my direct scope/team to remain in alignment on the needs of our customers and overall business goals. I use this information to inform how/when/where I deploy my quality practices. 
4. I actively contribute to quarterly/annual strategic planning for my team.
5. I have built/maintained relationships with cross-functional partners that allow me to effectively participate in product planning sessions where I successfully have quality initiatives prioritized as first class items that are actioned against with the right level of urgency an investment. 

**Quality Assessment**



1. The expectations for L3 SDET Quality Assessment are still applicable here (though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area)
2. I partner with managers to develop quality metrics/measurement KPI‚Äôs for the QA area and I contribute to setting thresholds, developing mitigation strategies, etc.

**Business Acumen**



1. I leverage my fluency in company business, products, customers, and strategy to identify opportunities where my team can help company meet its business objectives
